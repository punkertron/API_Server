## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a REST API server in C++ that allows users to upload and download files. The server will communicate with a PostgreSQL database to store file metadata and manage file operations.
---
## Requirements

* REST API Functionality: Implement REST API endpoints to handle file upload and download operations. The API should follow best practices, adhere to RESTful principles, and provide appropriate error handling.

* File Upload: Allow users to upload files to the server. The server should accept file uploads via HTTP POST requests and store the uploaded files on the server's file system or in a designated storage solution.

* File Download: Enable users to download files from the server. The server should provide endpoints to retrieve and download files based on unique identifiers or other specified criteria.

* PostgreSQL Integration: Integrate the server with a PostgreSQL database to store file metadata, such as file name, size, MIME type, and storage location. Use appropriate SQL queries and transactions to interact with the database.

* Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure authentication and authorization mechanism to protect file upload and download operations. Users should be authenticated before accessing the API, and authorization checks should be performed to ensure users can only access their own files or files with appropriate permissions.

* Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and response generation to handle various scenarios, such as invalid requests, authentication failures, database errors, and file operation failures.

* Security: Apply security best practices to protect the server and the files stored on it. This includes securing API endpoints, implementing secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), and ensuring proper file access controls.

* Testing: Develop comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality of the server and ensure it meets the requirements. Include tests for file upload, download, database interactions, authentication, and error handling.

## Technical Details

* Language: Develop the server using C++ programming language to leverage its performance and low-level capabilities.

* Web Framework: Choose a C++ web framework or library to facilitate the development of the REST API server. Consider frameworks such as Crow, Pistache, or CPPRESTSDK based on your requirements and familiarity.

* PostgreSQL Library: Use a C++ PostgreSQL library, such as libpqxx or pqxx, to interact with the PostgreSQL database and perform database operations.

* File Storage: Determine the file storage approach based on your requirements. You can store files on the server's file system or utilize a cloud-based storage service like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

* Authentication: Implement a secure authentication mechanism such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users and generate access tokens for API authorization.

* API Documentation: Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI Specification to facilitate client integration and provide clear instructions for API usage.

* Deployment: Decide on the deployment strategy for the server, considering factors such as scalability, performance, and security. Deploy the server on a reliable hosting environment or cloud platform, such as AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.

---
## Testing

* Develop a suite of unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality of the server, covering various scenarios and edge cases.

* Use testing frameworks like Google Test or Catch2 to write and execute the tests.

* Perform tests for file upload, download, database interactions, authentication, authorization, error handling, and any other critical functionality.

* Automate the testing process as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing code quality and reliability.

## Conclusion

By developing a REST API server in C++ integrated with a PostgreSQL database, you will enable users to securely upload and download files. Following the outlined technical details, meeting the requirements, and performing thorough testing will result in a robust and reliable file management service.
